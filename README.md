# yaml-thom

An incomplete and extremely rough YAML loader/dumper. Nothing is stable and no one should use this for any practical purpose.

The objectives of this project are to:

- Illustrate the YAML 1.2 spec with an implementation that follows the spec as closely as possible.
- Provide a test bed for experimental features.
