# yaml-thom

An experimental YAML loader/dumper implementation.

#### Primary objectives:

- Precisely implement the YAML 1.2 spec.
- Run (and pass) the [YAML test suite](https://github.com/yaml/yaml-test-suite).
- Serve as a reference implementation illustrating all parts of YAML processing in detail.
- Allow total configuration of the loading process.
- Function as a test bed for work on the YAML spec and related projects.

#### Secondary objectives

- Serve as a stable and library for practical applications.
- Allow detailed configuration of dumping.
- Provide a means for preserving presentational information.
- Sanely handle YAML 1.1.

#### Non-objectives

- High performance.
- Native library integration.

If you're looking for a stable, practical, high-quality YAML implementation to use in your application, I recommend [this one](https://github.com/eemeli/yaml).
